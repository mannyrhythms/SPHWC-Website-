        <h2>About Us pages should be creative and unique, but several factors distinguish an “okay” About page from an “amazing” one.

A great About Us page comes across as human. It puts a face to a name, showing your potential customers that you’re a real person. Any well-written About page makes the reader feel a sense of connection with the brand. It makes them feel like they know you and that you have something in common.

Instead of simply listing facts about the brand, quality About pages tell a story – one that has a beginning, middle, and end. How did the company start? What lessons did they learn while they were still growing? Where are they today?

Good About Us pages would be better named “About You” pages – because they should focus on the customer, their pain points, and how you can help them.</h2>
